# Overview

gAttendance is an attendance tracking app designed with Galvanize instructors in mind. The app was built to accurately track student attendance using RFID cards while saving time that would be lost to a manual tracking system. Additionally, instructors have access to a dashboard with persistent, real-time data and several filtering options.

## Technology

The gAttendance client uses React as a framework and JavaScript.

## How To Use

The gAttendance client is essentially plug-and-play. Once the Pi is hooked up and the back-end is seeded, the instructor dashboard should require no setup!
